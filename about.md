This is a website for publishing reviewed notebooks. The goal of this project is to promote ease-of-use in research code and reuseability. We provide a new way of review and submission process. You submit your notebook as pull request with the right format (defined for each programming language individually). The notebook will be reviewed openly accessible for everyone. Each notebook will have one reviewer assigned, but everyone can chime in and comment or suggest edits.
