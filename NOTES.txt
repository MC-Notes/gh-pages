References?
 - Use Calysto:
   * document-tools
   * provides make references
   * references are created using [CITE](#cite-<bibtex_cite_key)
   * creates #References cell at bottom of notebook
   * installation: https://github.com/Calysto/notebook-extensions
   * Drawbacks: 
     bibtex entries have to be inside the notebook, no external bibtex allowed
     no search functionality for bibtex entries
     have to install whole calysto project (users & when running notebook)

 - Make subtype of calysto:
   * Can make references from external file
   * make light-weight install available for document tools
   * include search for references
   * include nbconvert latex reference for pdf creation

 this allows to create pdf in travis
